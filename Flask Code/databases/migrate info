Use migrate to update a database table after changing the model for that table.

set FLASK_APP environment variable
export FLASK_APP='basic.py' # make sure you run it in the same directory as the file or put an absolute path
then from flask_migrate import Migrate into your basic.py file # install using pip install flask-migrate
create an instance of it
Migrate(app,db)

then from the terminal run
flask db init # this will create a migrate folder
flask db migrate -m 'Info Message'
then
flask db upgrade # to apply the changes you have made to the model to the database table
